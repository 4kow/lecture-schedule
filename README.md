This is one of my first projects that I developed, it is a simple desktop application which is useful for displaying the lecture schedule. 
I was using it when I was studying and it shows the lecture schedule for one person in first textbox and for the second person in second textbox.

All lecture data is hard-coded and there is no possibility to change it from the perspective of the user so first functionality that I would like to add to this app is
a simple SQL database which would hold the data about lectures, their times and the professors who give them and the possibility for the user to update the data by
himself. It would make this app complete and versatile. 

Develoiping of this app helped me to understand the basics of coding in c# and building simple desktop applications. It gave me the opportunity to get to know about how
to connect the frontend and the backend part of the application and it was useful for me on a daily basis as well.
